        <p>Based in the Western parts of Johannesburg, UFO is an organization which aims at helping the youth by offering multiple services that will take children off the streets. The services offered by the organization vary. They have sports such as soccer, rugby, tennis, cricket, basketball, just to name a few. Sporting events and tournaments are had every other week throughout the year in order to ensure that kids enjoy the competitiveness of the sport they partake in. A wide range of other extra-curricular activities such as chess, art class, dancing and even acting are available for those with a more creative side to explore. Extra classes from Grade 1 to Grade 12 are available as well to help kids who need a bit of help with their schoolwork.</p>
