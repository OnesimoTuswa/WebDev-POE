        <p>At the end of last year, the kids were taken to the beach to close off a very successful year for the organization. The kids were wonderfully captured during the sunset enjoying their time. During the year, the kids are also exposed to a variety of sports to partake in outside of school. In the previous year, we hosted a soccer tournament for all the age groups and, conveniently, it was won by us!</p>

        <p>Pictured is one of our kids learning how to play the guitar. There are a variety of other extracurricular activities that are available for those with more love for arts than sports. At the beginning of the year, we had one of our annual school visits at a primary school in the area. The students were jubilated at the activities that were presented by us infront of them.</p>
